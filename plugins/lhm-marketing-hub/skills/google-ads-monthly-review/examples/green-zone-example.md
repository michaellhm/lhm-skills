━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Your 5 Priority Actions (Low Urgency)

### 1. DOCUMENT SUCCESS: Record What's Working
**Priority**: This week

**Action**: Create a template/document noting:
- Current campaign structure
- Budget allocation percentages
- Negative keyword list from last month
- Top performing keywords and ads
- Any seasonal factors

**Reasoning**: When things work well, document it! This helps:
- Maintain consistency if you're away
- Train team members
- Apply learnings to similar clients
- Remember what changed if performance shifts


### 2. TEST NEW AD COPY: Low-Risk Experiments
**Priority**: This month

**Action**: Create ad variations for testing:
- Test 2-3 new headlines in Generic - Chiropractor
- Focus on different angles (convenience, expertise, conditions)
- Ensure all copy is AHPRA compliant
- Run A/B test at 50/50 split

**Reasoning**: Stable accounts are perfect for testing. If new ads
perform worse, the account absorbs the impact. If they perform better,
you've improved an already strong performer.


### 3. MONITOR COMPETITORS: Stay Alert
**Priority**: Weekly check

**Action**: Review competitive landscape:
- Note any new competitors in auction insights
- Check for new messaging in competitor ads
- Monitor impression share for changes
- Watch for CPCs creeping up

**Reasoning**: Green zone today doesn't mean green zone forever.
Competitors can appear or improve. Early detection prevents surprises.


### 4. PLAN NEXT MONTH: Anticipate Changes
**Priority**: End of this month

**Action**: Consider upcoming factors:
- Any seasonal changes? (Winter = more back pain?)
- Client promotions or offers?
- Budget changes for June?
- New services to advertise?

**Reasoning**: Proactive planning in Green zone beats reactive
scrambling in Red zone. Use the calm to prepare.


### 5. INCREMENTAL KEYWORD OPTIMISATION: Fine-Tuning
**Priority**: Bi-weekly

**Action**: Light keyword maintenance:
- Add negatives for any new irrelevant search terms
- Consider phrase match for top exact match performers
- Remove any severely underperforming keywords (if any)
- Check Quality Scores for opportunities

**Reasoning**: Even well-performing accounts have small improvements
available. Regular small optimisations compound over time.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Time Investment Recommendation

**For Green Zone accounts in maintenance mode:**

| Task | Time | Frequency |
|------|------|-----------|
| Quick performance check | 5 mins | 2x per week |
| Search terms review | 15 mins | Weekly |
| Competitive check | 10 mins | Weekly |
| Ad testing/optimisation | 30 mins | Monthly |
| Full strategy session | 15 mins | Monthly |

**Total time per month**: ~3-4 hours

This frees up time for Red/Orange accounts that need attention.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## ⚠️ APPROVAL / FEEDBACK

Since this account is healthy, there's no urgent action required.

**Please confirm**:
- Any of the 5 actions you'd like to prioritise?
- Anything specific you want to test or improve?
- Any upcoming changes I should know about?
- Happy to move to the next client?

For Green zone accounts, it's perfectly fine to:
- ✅ Do nothing urgent this month
- ✅ Focus time on struggling accounts instead
- ✅ Come back to this when testing opportunities arise
```

### User Approval

```
Great to hear it's in good shape! Let's do action 1 (documenting) and 2
(testing new ad copy) this month. I'll keep an eye on competitors weekly.

Actually, the client mentioned they're launching a new service - sports
injury treatment - in June. Can you note that for planning?

Let's move to the next client - I've got a couple in worse shape that
need attention first.
```

### Claude's Next Steps

```
Perfect - documenting success and testing are great Green zone activities.
And great intel about the June service launch!
