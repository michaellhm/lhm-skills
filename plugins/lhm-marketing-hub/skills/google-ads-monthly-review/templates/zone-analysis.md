## 🔴 Red Zone Analysis

### Characteristics
- **Budget**: Overspending (>110% of target pace)
- **Performance**: Poor (CPA >110% of target OR ROAS <90% of target)
- **Urgency**: CRITICAL - Same day action required

### Common Causes
1. Broad match keywords capturing irrelevant traffic
2. Competitor activity driving up CPCs
3. Landing page issues killing conversion rate
4. Seasonal demand shift not anticipated
5. Budget increased without performance monitoring
6. Smart bidding targeting wrong conversions
7. Geographic expansion performing poorly

### Priority Actions
1. **Immediate**: Reduce campaign budgets by 20-30%
2. **Same Day**: Run search terms report, add negative keywords
3. **24 Hours**: Pause highest-cost, zero-conversion keywords
4. **48 Hours**: Review landing pages for issues
5. **Week 1**: Test new ad copy with different messaging

### Expected Resolution Time
- Spend control: 1-2 days
- Performance improvement: 1-2 weeks

### Key Metrics to Track
- Daily spend vs target
- Search term quality
- Landing page conversion rate
- Impression share (budget lost)
