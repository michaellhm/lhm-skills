## 5. PROJECTED IMPACT

### Before vs After

| Metric | Current | Projected | Change |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Monthly Spend | $4,288 | ~$2,800 | -35% |
| Conversions | 44 | ~38 | -14% |
| CPA | $97 | ~$74 | -24% |
| Waste | $2,584 | ~$400 | -85% |

**Why conversions only drop 14% when spend drops 35%:**
We're cutting spend on zero-conversion and high-CPA keywords.
The remaining budget focuses on keywords that actually convert.

1. [ ] keyword-recommendations-perth-chiro-2024-07-22.csv
2. [ ] negative-keywords-generic-back-pain.txt
3. [ ] Summary report (markdown)

**Confirm actions:**
- [ ] Pause 3 zero/high-waste keywords
- [ ] Add 42 negative keywords
- [ ] Change "lower back pain" from broad to phrase
- [ ] Reduce bid on "back pain doctor" by 30%
```

### User Approval

```
Yes, generate all the files. The negatives list looks good - we
definitely don't do bulk billing so that's fine to block.

One question: should I change "lower back pain" to phrase match
before or after adding the negatives?
```

### Claude's Output

```
Great question! **Add negatives first, then change match type.**

Here's why:
1. Adding negatives immediately stops the bleeding from bad search terms
2. Changing to phrase match before negatives could still show for
   "lower back pain exercises" etc.
3. Once negatives are in, phrase match is safer to implement

## Key Takeaways from This Example

### What Made This Ad Group Problematic

1. **60% wasted spend** - Majority of budget going to non-converters
2. **DIY intent keywords** - "exercises" attracted wrong audience
3. **Broad match too broad** - "lower back pain" matching everything
4. **No negatives** - Common waste patterns not blocked

### Why These Actions Were Recommended

1. **Pause high-waste keywords** - Immediate savings, no conversion loss
2. **42 negatives** - Block identified waste patterns
3. **Match type restriction** - Control what triggers ads
4. **Protect top performers** - Don't damage what's working

### Keyword Optimization Best Practices

- Start with search terms report - it shows real waste
- Group negatives by pattern (DIY, jobs, research, etc.)
- Add negatives before changing match types
- Protect your winners while cutting losers
- Monitor for 7 days after changes
- Document changes for client reporting

### Pattern Recognition for Negatives

The example identified 6 waste patterns:
1. DIY/Exercise seekers
2. Research/Information seekers
3. Job/Career seekers
4. Irrelevant conditions (pregnancy, emergency)
5. Product/Price shoppers
6. Wrong service comparisons

These patterns apply to most healthcare accounts.
