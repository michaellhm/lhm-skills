# Content Gap Analysis

Identifies opportunities where competitors have content coverage that the client does not, and surfaces keyword, topic, and format gaps to inform content strategy.

## When to Use This Skill

- Finding keyword opportunities competitors rank for but you don't
- Auditing competitor content strategy for gaps to exploit
- Building a content calendar based on data
- Identifying missing content across the buyer journey
- Discovering untapped topics in your niche
- Planning topic clusters and pillar content
- Finding GEO/AI citation gaps where competitors get cited and you don't

## What This Skill Does

1. **Content Inventory Audit** — maps existing content coverage
2. **Competitor Content Analysis** — identifies what competitors cover
3. **Keyword Gap Analysis** — finds ranking gaps vs competitors
4. **Topic Gap Mapping** — surfaces missing topics and subtopics
5. **Content Format Gap Analysis** — identifies missing formats (video, guides, tools)
6. **GEO/AI Gap Analysis** — checks if competitors are being cited by AI systems
7. **Prioritized Action Plan** — recommends what to create first

## Data Sources

**With Google Search Console connected:**
Pull current keyword rankings, click-through rates, and page performance to establish the content baseline.

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user for:
1. Their site URL and top 5-10 existing content URLs
2. 3-5 competitor URLs
3. Target keywords or topics
4. Business goals and target audience

## Instructions

When a user requests a content gap analysis:

### 1. Define Analysis Scope

```markdown
### Analysis Scope

**Your site**: [URL]
**Competitors**:
1. [Competitor 1]
2. [Competitor 2]
3. [Competitor 3]

**Focus area**: [industry/topic vertical]
**Target audience**: [who are we writing for]
**Business goal**: [leads/traffic/authority/sales]
```

### 2. Content Inventory Audit

Map what the client already covers:

```markdown
### Current Content Inventory

| URL | Primary Keyword | Topic | Type | Est. Monthly Traffic |
|-----|----------------|-------|------|---------------------|
| [url] | [keyword] | [topic] | [blog/guide/landing] | [traffic] |

**Total pages**: [X]
**Topic clusters identified**: [list]
**Buyer journey coverage**:
- Awareness: [X] pages
- Consideration: [X] pages
- Decision: [X] pages
- Retention: [X] pages
```

### 3. Competitor Content Analysis

For each competitor, audit their content:

```markdown
### Competitor: [Name]

**Content volume**: [X] pages indexed
**Publishing frequency**: ~[X] posts/month
**Top-performing content**:
1. [Title] — [keyword] — [est. traffic]
2. [Title] — [keyword] — [est. traffic]
3. [Title] — [keyword] — [est. traffic]

**Content types used**: [blog, video, tools, templates, etc.]
**Topic clusters**: [list their main topic areas]
**Unique angles**: [what they cover that nobody else does]
```

### 4. Keyword Gap Analysis

Find keywords competitors rank for that the client doesn't:

```markdown
### Keyword Gaps

| Keyword | Search Volume | Competitor Ranking | Your Ranking | Difficulty | Priority |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| [keyword] | [vol] | [pos] | Not ranking | [diff] | High/Med/Low |

**High-opportunity keywords** (high volume, competitor ranks top 10, you don't rank):
1. [keyword] — [volume] — [rationale]
2. [keyword] — [volume] — [rationale]

**Quick-win keywords** (you rank 11-20, competitor ranks top 5):
1. [keyword] — your pos [X] — [what to do]
2. [keyword] — your pos [X] — [what to do]
```

### 5. Topic Gap Mapping

Identify topics and subtopics with no coverage:

```markdown
### Topic Gaps

| Topic | Subtopics Missing | Competitor Coverage | Search Demand | Priority |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------|
| [topic] | [list] | [who covers it] | [volume] | High/Med/Low |

**Pillar content opportunities**:
1. [Topic] — could anchor a cluster of [X] supporting pages
2. [Topic] — addresses [buyer journey stage] gap

**Long-tail opportunities**:
1. [Question-based topic] — PAA/featured snippet potential
2. [Question-based topic] — low competition, high intent
```

### 6. Content Format Gap Analysis

```markdown
### Format Gaps

| Format | You | Comp 1 | Comp 2 | Comp 3 | Opportunity |
|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| How-to guides | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | [notes] |
| Comparison pages | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | [notes] |
| Templates/tools | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | [notes] |
| Video content | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | [notes] |
| Case studies | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | [notes] |
| FAQ/glossary | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | [notes] |
```

### 7. GEO/AI Gap Analysis

Check if competitors are being cited by AI systems:

```markdown
### AI Citation Gap Analysis

**Queries checked**: [list of target queries tested in AI systems]

| Query | AI System | Cited Source | Your Content Cited? | Gap |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------------|----|
| [query] | Google AI Overview | [competitor] | No | [what's missing] |
| [query] | Perplexity | [competitor] | No | [what's missing] |

**Why competitors get cited**:
- [Reason 1: e.g. clear definitions, quotable stats]
- [Reason 2]

**What to add for AI citations**:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]
```

### 8. Audience Journey Mapping

```markdown
### Content Coverage by Buyer Journey

| Stage | Their Questions | Your Content | Gap |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-----|
| **Awareness** | [questions] | [existing pages or "none"] | [gap] |
| **Consideration** | [questions] | [existing pages or "none"] | [gap] |
| **Decision** | [questions] | [existing pages or "none"] | [gap] |
| **Retention** | [questions] | [existing pages or "none"] | [gap] |
```

### 9. Prioritized Action Plan

```markdown
### Content Creation Priorities

**Tier 1 — Create immediately** (high impact, competitive gap):
1. **[Content title]** — targets [keyword], [volume] monthly searches
   - Type: [blog/guide/landing/comparison]
   - Why: [rationale — fills gap, high volume, low competition]
2. **[Content title]** — ...

**Tier 2 — Create next** (medium impact, strategic value):
1. **[Content title]** — ...
2. **[Content title]** — ...

**Tier 3 — Optimize existing** (quick wins on current content):
1. **[Page URL]** — add [missing subtopic/keyword] to improve from pos [X] to top 5
2. **[Page URL]** — ...

**Estimated impact**: [X] additional keywords ranked, [X] estimated monthly traffic gain
```

## Validation Checkpoints

### Input Validation
- [ ] Client site URL and at least 2 competitor URLs provided
- [ ] Target audience and business goals defined
- [ ] Access to keyword data (Search Console, or user-provided)

### Output Validation
- [ ] At least 10 keyword gaps identified with volume and difficulty
- [ ] Topic gaps mapped across buyer journey stages
- [ ] Action plan prioritized in 3 tiers
- [ ] GEO/AI citation gaps assessed
- [ ] Every recommendation tied to data, not assumptions

## Tips for Success

1. **Focus on intent, not just volume** — a 200-volume keyword with buying intent beats a 10K informational keyword
2. **Look at what's NOT ranking** — sometimes the biggest opportunity is a topic nobody covers well
3. **Check AI citations** — being cited by ChatGPT/Perplexity is becoming as valuable as ranking #1
4. **Map the full journey** — most gaps are in consideration and decision stages, not awareness
5. **Prioritize ruthlessly** — 5 excellent pages beat 50 thin ones
