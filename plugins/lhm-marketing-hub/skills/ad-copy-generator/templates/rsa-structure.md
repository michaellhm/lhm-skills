## Pinning Guidelines

### What is Pinning?

Pinning locks a headline or description to a specific position.

### When to Pin

| Position | When to Pin |
|----------|-------------|
| Headline 1 | Brand name or primary keyword for consistency |
| Headline 2 | Usually don't pin - let Google optimise |
| Headline 3 | CTA headline if you want CTA always visible |
| Description 1 | Usually don't pin |
| Description 2 | Usually don't pin |

### Pinning Best Practices

**DO:**
- Pin brand/keyword to Position 1 if important for brand consistency
- Test pinned vs unpinned versions

**DON'T:**
- Over-pin (reduces Google's ability to optimise)
- Pin more than 2-3 items total
- Pin descriptions unless necessary

### Impact of Pinning

| Pinning Level | Ad Strength Impact | Recommendation |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| No pins | Best Ad Strength | Let Google optimise |
| 1-2 pins | Minor impact | OK for key messages |
| 3+ pins | Significant impact | Avoid unless necessary |

---

## Ad Strength Indicators

### What Affects Ad Strength?

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Headline variety | High |
| Description variety | High |
| Keyword inclusion | Medium |
| Unique content | Medium |
| Pinning | Medium (negative) |
| Character usage | Low |

### Achieving "Excellent" Ad Strength

1. **Use all 15 headlines** - Variety is key
2. **Use all 4 descriptions** - More options = better testing
3. **Include keywords** - At least 2-3 headlines should contain keywords
4. **Vary messaging** - Don't repeat the same idea
5. **Avoid over-pinning** - Let Google optimise
6. **Use full character count** - Longer copy when valuable
