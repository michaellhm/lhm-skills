# Landing Page Optimizer

## Purpose

Audit landing pages for conversion optimisation, identify issues affecting performance, and generate AHPRA-compliant copy improvements. Get a scored audit with prioritised recommendations and A/B test suggestions.

## When to Use

- **Low conversion rate** - Good CTR but poor conversion
- **New landing page review** - Before launching a new page
- **Client requests feedback** - Landing page review for client
- **After ad copy changes** - Ensure page aligns with new messaging
- **Quarterly audits** - Regular conversion optimisation

## Prerequisites

- Landing page URL or full page copy
- Conversion goal (booking, form submission, phone call)
- Target keywords the page should align with
- Current conversion rate (if known)
- Any specific concerns to investigate

## How It Works

### Step 1: Gather Information

I'll ask you for:

1. **Landing Page**: URL or paste the content
2. **Conversion Goal**: What action should visitors take?
3. **Target Keywords**: What keywords drive traffic to this page?
4. **Current Performance**: Conversion rate, bounce rate if known
5. **Specific Concerns**: Any areas you want me to focus on?

### Step 2: Above-Fold Analysis

Evaluate the first screen visitors see:
- Headline clarity and impact

- Primary CTA visibility and copy
- Trust signals present
- Hero image/visual relevance
- Load time considerations

### Step 3: Content Structure Review

Analyse full page content:

### Step 4: Mobile Optimisation Check

Evaluate mobile experience:
- Touch target sizes (min 44px)
- Readable text without zooming
- CTA visibility on mobile
- Form usability on mobile
- Click-to-call functionality

### Step 5: Technical Elements

Consider technical factors:

- Form submission process

### Step 6: AHPRA Compliance

Check all copy for healthcare compliance:
- Headlines and CTAs
- Service descriptions
- Testimonials (consent required)
- Claims and promises

### Step 7: Generate Recommendations

Produce:
