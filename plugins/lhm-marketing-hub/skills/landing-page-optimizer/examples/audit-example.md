📅 Date: 12th September 2024

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## OVERALL SCORE: 48/100 (4.8/10)

⚠️ **Below Average** - Major improvements needed

### Score Breakdown

| Category | Score | Max | Status |
|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| Hero Section | 8 | 20 | ❌ Poor |
| Value Proposition | 6 | 15 | ❌ Poor |
| Social Proof | 5 | 15 | ❌ Poor |
| Call-to-Action | 7 | 15 | ❌ Poor |
| Forms | 4 | 10 | ❌ Critical |
| Mobile Experience | 5 | 10 | ❌ Poor |
| Content Quality | 8 | 10 | ⚠️ Fair |
| AHPRA Compliance | 0 | 5 | ❌ FAIL |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### Issue 1: AHPRA COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS

**Severity: CRITICAL**

**Problem:** The "Why Choose Us" section contains multiple AHPRA violations:

> "We are the **leading** optometrist in Canberra with the **most advanced** equipment and **best service**. Our team **guarantees** you'll see better after visiting us."

**Violations:**
- ❌ "leading" - Superlative without proof
- ❌ "most advanced" - Superlative without proof
- ❌ "best service" - Superlative without proof
- ❌ "guarantees you'll see better" - Guaranteed outcome

**Risk:** AHPRA complaint, potential regulatory action

**Fix (AHPRA Compliant):**
> "At Canberra Optometry Centre, our experienced team uses modern diagnostic technology to provide comprehensive eye care. We're committed to supporting your eye health."

**Priority:** Fix TODAY - This is a compliance risk


### Issue 2: FORM HAS TOO MANY FIELDS (8 fields)

**Severity: HIGH**

**Problem:** 8 form fields creates friction, especially on mobile:
1. Name
2. Email
3. Phone
4. Preferred Date
5. Preferred Time
6. Type of Appointment
7. How did you hear about us?
8. Any specific concerns?

**Impact:** Every additional field reduces conversion by ~10%. 8 fields could be reducing conversions by 50%+.

**Mobile Impact:** This explains the 1.3% mobile conversion rate. Filling 8 fields on mobile is tedious.

**Fix:** Reduce to essential fields only:
1. Name
2. Phone
3. Preferred Date (optional)
4. Message (optional)

Move "How did you hear about us?" to confirmation page or remove.

**Expected Impact:** +30-50% conversion improvement


### Issue 3: NO CTA ABOVE THE FOLD

**Severity: HIGH**

**Problem:** The "Book Online" link is only in the header (small), and the form is at the bottom of the page. Visitors must scroll to take action.

**Impact:** 58% bounce rate suggests visitors leave without seeing the form.

**Mobile Impact:** Mobile users on small screens may never scroll to find the form.

**Fix:**
- Add prominent "Book Your Eye Test" button in hero section
- Make header "Book Online" larger and more prominent
- Consider sticky CTA on mobile

**Expected Impact:** +20-30% conversion improvement

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Fix This Week)

### Issue 4: Generic Headline Doesn't Address Search Intent

**Problem:**
> "Welcome to Canberra Optometry Centre"

This headline:
- Doesn't address why they searched
- Doesn't mention eye tests, vision, or eye health
- Doesn't include relevant keywords
- Feels like a template

**Visitor Expectation:** They searched "optometrist canberra" - they want eye care, not a welcome message.

**Fix Options (AHPRA Compliant):**
1. "Due for an Eye Test? Canberra's Trusted Optometrists"
2. "Comprehensive Eye Exams in Canberra"
3. "Expert Eye Care for All Ages | Bulk Billing Available"

**Expected Impact:** +15-25% engagement improvement


### Issue 5: Weak Social Proof

**Problem:**
> "Great service!" - John S.
> "Very professional" - Mary T.

These testimonials:
- Are too generic (could be for any business)
- Don't mention specific services or outcomes
- Don't feel authentic
- May not meet AHPRA testimonial requirements

**Fix:**
- Get more detailed testimonials with specific experiences
- Add Google review rating widget
- Include number of patients served (if verifiable)
- Ensure proper consent documentation

**Better Testimonial Example:**
> "The team took time to explain my options for managing my eye condition. Very thorough assessment and I felt well-informed about my eye health." - John S., Civic

**Expected Impact:** +10-15% trust improvement


### Issue 6: Stock Photo Reduces Trust

**Problem:** Generic stock photo of optometry equipment doesn't build connection.

**Fix:**
- Replace with photo of actual practice
- Show real team members
- Include photo of practice interior

**Expected Impact:** +5-10% trust improvement

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🟠 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next 2 Weeks)

### Issue 7: No Phone Number Prominence

**Problem:** Phone number is in header but not emphasised. No click-to-call on mobile.

**Fix:**
- Make phone number larger in hero
- Add "Call Us: 02 6XXX XXXX" as secondary CTA
- Ensure click-to-call works on mobile

### Issue 8: Bulk Billing Not Highlighted

**Problem:** "Bulk billing available" is buried in services list. This is a key differentiator.

**Fix:**
- Add "Bulk Billing Eye Tests" to headline or subheadline
- Create prominent callout for bulk billing eligibility

### Issue 9: No FAQ Section

**Problem:** Common questions not addressed:
- How long does an eye test take?
- Do I need to bring anything?
- What does bulk billing cover?

**Fix:** Add FAQ section above the form.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (When Time Permits)

- Add team member photos and bios
- Include video tour of practice
- Add schema markup for local business
- Implement live chat option

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## MOBILE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

Given the 1.3% mobile conversion rate, prioritise:

1. **Reduce form fields** - Critical for mobile
2. **Add sticky CTA** - Always visible on scroll
3. **Increase touch target sizes** - Min 44px buttons
4. **Click-to-call phone** - Primary mobile action
5. **Test on actual devices** - Not just responsive view

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## A/B TEST RECOMMENDATIONS

### Test 1: Headline Variation
**Hypothesis:** Problem-focused headline will convert better than welcome message

| Version | Headline |
|---------|----------|
| Control | "Welcome to Canberra Optometry Centre" |
| Variant | "Due for an Eye Test? Canberra's Trusted Optometrists" |

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Expected Lift:** 20-30%

### Test 2: Form Length
**Hypothesis:** Shorter form will increase submissions

| Version | Fields |
|---------|--------|
| Control | 8 fields |
| Variant | 4 fields (Name, Phone, Date, Message) |

**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Expected Lift:** 30-50%

### Test 3: CTA Above Fold
**Hypothesis:** Above-fold CTA will capture more conversions

| Version | CTA Location |
|---------|--------------|
| Control | Form at bottom only |
| Variant | Button in hero + form at bottom |

**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Expected Lift:** 20-30%

## AUDIT REPORT SUMMARY

---

**Landing Page Audit: Canberra Optometry Centre**
**Date:** 12th September 2024

**Overall Score:** 48/100 (Below Average)

**Critical Issues:**
1. AHPRA compliance violations - FIX TODAY
2. Form too long (8 fields) - Major friction
3. No CTA above fold - Missing conversions

**Root Cause of Performance Drop:**
The combination of AHPRA-violating content (may trigger ad disapprovals),
excessive form fields, and poor mobile experience explains the drop from
4.2% to 2.1% conversion rate.

**Quick Wins:**
1. Rewrite AHPRA-violating content (compliance)
2. Reduce form to 4 fields (+30-50% conversions)
3. Add above-fold CTA (+20-30% conversions)

**Expected Recovery:**
Implementing these changes should return conversion rate to 3.5-4.5%
within 2-4 weeks.

---

Good luck with the updates! The AHPRA fix is critical - please prioritise that.

## Key Takeaways from This Example

### What Made This Landing Page Underperform

1. **AHPRA violations** - "Guarantee" and superlatives
2. **8-field form** - Major conversion friction
3. **CTA below fold** - Visitors bounce before seeing it
4. **Generic headline** - Doesn't address search intent
5. **Weak social proof** - Generic testimonials
6. **Poor mobile experience** - 1.3% mobile conversion

### Why These Issues Caused the Performance Drop

1. **AHPRA content** may have triggered Quality Score drops
2. **Form friction** increased abandonment
3. **Mobile users** couldn't easily convert
4. **No differentiation** meant higher bounce rates

### Landing Page Audit Best Practices

1. **Check compliance first** - AHPRA issues are critical
2. **Focus on mobile** - Most healthcare searches are mobile
3. **Reduce friction** - Fewer fields = more submissions
4. **CTA above fold** - Don't hide the action
5. **Match ad to page** - Headline should address search intent
6. **Real testimonials** - Generic quotes don't build trust

### Score Interpretation

- **48/100** = Below average, major issues
- **Critical issues** = Fix immediately
- **Expected recovery** = 3.5-4.5% with fixes implemented
