# Quotable Content Examples

Before/after examples of content optimized for AI citation.

## Example 1: Definition

**Before**: "SEO is really important for businesses and involves various techniques to improve visibility online."

**After**: "**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** is a digital marketing practice that improves website rankings in organic search results through content optimization, technical improvements, and authority building. According to BrightEdge, organic search drives 53% of all website traffic."

**Why it works**: Clear classification, specific components, authoritative stat, standalone statement.

## Example 2: Statistics

**Before**: "Email marketing is pretty effective and lots of companies use it."

**After**: "Email marketing delivers an average ROI of $42 for every $1 spent (Data & Marketing Association, 2024). This 4,200% return makes email the highest-performing digital marketing channel, outperforming social media (28%) and paid search (23%)."

**Why it works**: Specific numbers, source attribution, comparative data, verifiable.

## Example 3: Process

**Before**: "To do keyword research, think about what customers might search for and use some tools."

**After**: "To conduct effective keyword research: 1) **Identify seed keywords** — list 5-10 core topics. 2) **Expand with tools** — use Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs for 100+ variations. 3) **Analyze intent** — categorize as informational, commercial, or transactional. 4) **Assess competition** — evaluate difficulty via domain authority. 5) **Prioritize** — select 10-15 keywords balancing volume with achievable competition."

**Why it works**: Numbered steps, specific actions, concrete numbers, actionable.

## Example 4: Comparison

**Before**: "WordPress and Shopify are both popular. WordPress is more flexible while Shopify is easier."

**After**:

| Factor | WordPress | Shopify |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Best for | Content-heavy sites, custom needs | E-commerce, quick setup |
| Setup time | 4-8 hours | 1-2 hours |
| Monthly cost | $10-50 | $29-299 |
| Customization | Unlimited (50,000+ plugins) | Limited to Shopify apps |

**Why it works**: Table format, specific metrics, quantifiable differences.

## Example 5: Q&A

**Before**: "How long does SEO take? It depends on a lot of factors."

**After**: "SEO typically takes 3-6 months to show significant results for new websites. Established sites may see improvements in 1-3 months for less competitive keywords. Key factors: domain authority (new = 6-12 months), competition level (low = 1-3 months), and backlink profile (20+ quality backlinks = 40% faster improvement per Ahrefs)."

**Why it works**: Specific timeframes, scenario-based, data-backed, actionable.

## Transformation Pattern

1. **Add specificity** — replace "many" with "73%"
2. **Include attribution** — add sources for all claims
3. **Structure clearly** — tables, lists, numbered steps
4. **Quantify** — numbers beat adjectives
5. **Make standalone** — each statement works in isolation
6. **Add context** — explain why, not just what
7. **Include timeframes** — when was this measured?
8. **Show authority** — reference experts, studies, data
