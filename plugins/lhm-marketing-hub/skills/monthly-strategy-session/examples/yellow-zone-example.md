## Zone Assessment: 🟡 YELLOW - Scaling Opportunity

### Budget Analysis
- Monthly Budget: $2,000
- Expected Spend (Day 8): $533 (26.7% of month)
- Actual Spend: $625
- **Budget Pacing: 117%** - Slightly over but...

Wait - let me recalculate based on daily budgets:
- Total Daily Budget: $105/day
- Maximum monthly spend possible: $3,150
- Expected daily spend: $66.67 ($2,000/30)
- **Actually, campaigns are capped below potential**

Looking at impression share data would help, but based on the strong
CPAs and client feedback about capacity, this is a scaling opportunity.

### Performance Analysis
- Target CPA: $60
- Actual CPA: $34.72 (18 conversions from $625)
- **Performance: 58% of target** ✅ Excellent!

All campaigns are performing well under target CPA.

### Campaign Breakdown

| Campaign | Spend | Conv | CPA | vs Target | Status |
|----------|-------|------|-----|-----------|--------|
| Brand - Coastal Optometry | $180 | 8 | $22.50 | 38% ✅ | Excellent |
| Generic - Eye Exam | $220 | 5 | $44.00 | 73% ✅ | Strong |
| Generic - Optometrist | $140 | 3 | $46.67 | 78% ✅ | Strong |
| Bulk Billing - Eye Test | $85 | 2 | $42.50 | 71% ✅ | Strong (New) |

🎯 **All campaigns performing below target CPA - ideal for scaling**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Your 5 Priority Actions

### 1. INCREASE BUDGETS: Scale Top Performers
**Est. Impact**: +50-80% more conversions this month

**Action**: Increase daily budgets:
- Brand - Coastal Optometry: $25 → $35 (+40%)
- Generic - Eye Exam: $35 → $50 (+43%)
- Generic - Optometrist: $25 → $35 (+40%)
- Bulk Billing - Eye Test: $20 → $30 (+50%)

**Reasoning**: With CPAs at 38-78% of target, there's significant headroom
to scale. Even if CPAs increase 20-30% with scaling, you'll still be under target.

**New Total Daily Budget**: $150/day (was $105/day)
**Projected Monthly Spend**: ~$1,800-2,000 (on budget)


### 2. EXPAND KEYWORDS: Add Related Terms
**Est. Impact**: +20-30% more impression volume

**Action**: Add keywords to Generic - Eye Exam:
- "comprehensive eye exam"
- "eye health check"
- "vision test near me"
- "eye examination [suburb names]"

**Reasoning**: If campaigns are limited by search volume rather than budget,
adding related keywords opens up more auction inventory to compete in.


### 3. TEST BROADER MATCH: Top Exact Match Keywords
**Est. Impact**: +15-25% more volume, identify new terms

**Action**: For best-performing exact match keywords:
- Add phrase match versions
- Monitor search terms weekly
- Add negatives as needed

**Reasoning**: Exact match is great for control, but may be limiting reach.
Phrase match (with good negatives) can capture relevant variations.


### 4. EXTEND AD SCHEDULE: Capture More Hours
**Est. Impact**: +10-15% more impressions

**Action**: Review current ad schedule:
- If running limited hours, test extended hours
- If 6am-9pm, test 6am-10pm
- Monitor performance by hour for any drop-off

**Reasoning**: If there's demand outside current hours, you're missing
potential bookings. Start with small extensions to test.


### 5. NURTURE BULK BILLING: Let It Grow
**Est. Impact**: Establish new conversion source

**Action**: For the new Bulk Billing campaign:
- Don't judge too early - only 2 weeks of data
- Increase budget modestly: $20 → $30
- Add more keyword variations
- Create dedicated landing page if not already

**Reasoning**: New campaigns need time to build data and optimise.
The early $42.50 CPA is promising - give it room to grow.

## Net Impact Projection

If we implement all 5 actions:

| Metric | Current Pace | Projected | Change |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Monthly Spend | ~$1,400 | ~$1,900 | +36% |
| Monthly Conv | ~35 (trend) | ~50-55 | +50% |
| Avg CPA | $35 | ~$38-42 | +8-20% |
| vs Budget | 70% utilised | 95% utilised | +25% |
| Client Bookings | ~35/month | ~50/month | +15 bookings |

**Important**: CPAs may rise slightly with scaling - this is normal.
As long as they stay under $60 target, you're in great shape.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## ⚠️ APPROVAL REQUIRED

Before proceeding, please confirm:

**Which actions would you like to tackle?**
- [ ] 1. Increase budgets on all campaigns
- [ ] 2. Expand keywords
- [ ] 3. Test broader match types
- [ ] 4. Extend ad schedule
- [ ] 5. Nurture bulk billing campaign

**Any concerns?**
- Are you comfortable with CPAs potentially rising to $45-50?
- Does the client have capacity for 50+ bookings/month?
- Any keyword areas to avoid expanding into?
```

### User Approval

```
This is great! The client definitely has capacity - they mentioned they could
handle double the current bookings.

Let's do actions 1, 2, and 5. I want to be a bit more careful with broader
match types (#3) and ad schedule (#4) - let's save those for next month
if the budget increases go well.

For keywords, focus on the northern beaches suburbs - that's their main
service area. Avoid anything related to bulk billing claims/rebates in
the generic campaigns - that messaging is only for the dedicated campaign.
```

### Claude's Next Steps

```
Perfect approach - scaling gradually is smart. Let's implement the
approved actions with your specific guidance.

## Approved Actions

### 1. Budget Increases (Implement Now)

| Campaign | Current | New | Increase |
|----------|---------|-----|----------|
| Brand - Coastal Optometry | $25/day | $35/day | +40% |
| Generic - Eye Exam | $35/day | $50/day | +43% |
| Generic - Optometrist | $25/day | $35/day | +40% |
| Bulk Billing - Eye Test | $20/day | $30/day | +50% |

**New Total Daily Budget**: $150/day
**Projected Monthly Spend**: $1,850-$2,000 ✅


### 2. Keyword Expansion - Northern Beaches Focus

**For Generic - Eye Exam, add:**
- "eye exam manly"
- "eye exam dee why"
- "eye test northern beaches"
- "comprehensive eye exam manly"
- "eye health check dee why"
- "vision test brookvale"
- "optometrist eye exam northern beaches"

**For Generic - Optometrist, add:**
- "optometrist manly"
- "optometrist dee why"
- "optometrist northern beaches"
- "local optometrist [suburbs]"

**Negative Keywords to Add (protecting from bulk billing messaging):**
- "bulk billing" (for generic campaigns only)
- "bulk billed"
- "medicare" (for generic campaigns only)
- "free eye test"

This ensures bulk billing queries go to the dedicated campaign.


### 3. Nurture Bulk Billing Campaign

**Budget**: $20 → $30/day

**Additional Keywords to Test:**
- "bulk billing eye test northern beaches"
- "free eye exam [eligible conditions]"
- "pensioner eye test"
- "health care card eye exam"

**Monitor closely** for 2 more weeks before major changes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Recommended Next Skill

Since you're in a scaling mode with strong fundamentals, I recommend:

→ **Run Ad Copy Generator** for Generic - Eye Exam

**Why**: With increased budget, fresh ad copy can help:
- Improve click-through rates
- Test new messaging angles
- Ensure AHPRA compliance on any claims
- A/B test against current ads

**When**: In 2 weeks, after budget changes have taken effect

For now, focus on implementing the budget and keyword changes.

## Key Takeaways from This Example

### What Made This Yellow Zone

1. **Strong performance** - All campaigns under target CPA (58% average)
2. **Budget headroom** - Only using 70% of available budget
3. **Client capacity** - Explicitly mentioned ability to handle more bookings
4. **New opportunity** - Bulk billing campaign showing early promise

### Why These Actions Were Recommended

1. **Budget increases** - Immediate, low-risk way to get more conversions
2. **Keyword expansion** - Increase auction inventory with geographic focus
3. **Nurture new campaign** - Patient growth of promising new channel
4. **Deferred actions** - User wisely chose to scale gradually

### Yellow Zone Best Practices

- Scale incrementally (10-20% budget increases)
- Expect CPAs to rise slightly - that's okay if still under target
- Focus on geographic/service area relevance
- Protect messaging consistency across campaigns
- Monitor weekly during scaling period
- Confirm client capacity before scaling

### Why Not All 5 Actions?

The user made a smart choice to defer broader match and ad schedule changes:
- Simpler to attribute results with fewer variables
- Can test those in subsequent months
- Maintains control during initial scaling
- Demonstrates thoughtful, phased approach
