## The Conversation

### User Input

```
[Pastes SKILL.md content]

I'll provide CSV data. Here's the campaign performance for Brisbane Physio Clinic:

Campaign,Cost,Conversions,CPA,Daily Budget
Brand - Brisbane Physio,420,12,35,40
Generic - Physio Brisbane,580,4,145,60
Generic - Back Pain,350,2,175,40
Generic - Sports Physio,280,3,93,35
Competitor - Alternative Clinics,170,0,0,25

Total spend so far: $1,800
Days into month: 5
Monthly budget: $3,000
Target CPA: $50

I've noticed a lot more competitor ads appearing, and the 'back pain' campaign
has been underperforming for weeks. The client mentioned they're seeing fewer
bookings compared to last month.

## Your 5 Priority Actions

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Cut Budgets on Critical Campaigns
**Est. Impact**: Save $800+ this month

**Action**: Reduce daily budgets:
- Generic - Physio Brisbane: $60 → $25 (58% reduction)
- Generic - Back Pain: $40 → $15 (63% reduction)
- Competitor - Alternative: $25 → $10 or Pause (60% reduction or pause)

**Reasoning**: These campaigns are hemorrhaging budget with CPAs 2-3x target.
Cutting budgets immediately stops the bleeding while we diagnose the issues.


### 2. TODAY: Run Search Terms Report on Critical Campaigns
**Est. Impact**: Identify 50%+ of wasted spend

**Action**: Pull search terms for last 14 days on:
- Generic - Physio Brisbane
- Generic - Back Pain
- Competitor - Alternative

**Reasoning**: High CPAs usually indicate poor keyword targeting. The search
terms report will show exactly what queries are triggering ads and wasting money.


### 3. WITHIN 24 HOURS: Add Negative Keywords
**Est. Impact**: Reduce wasted clicks by 30-50%

**Action**: Based on search terms report, add negatives for:
- Irrelevant locations (outside service area)
- DIY/information seekers ("exercises for", "how to treat")
- Unrelated conditions
- Job seekers ("physio jobs", "careers")

**Reasoning**: Your competitor observation suggests more competition for
good keywords, meaning you're likely appearing for more irrelevant terms.


### 4. WITHIN 48 HOURS: Review Landing Pages
**Est. Impact**: Potential 20-30% conversion improvement

**Action**: Check landing pages for:
- Generic - Physio Brisbane: Message match with ads?
- Generic - Back Pain: Specific to back pain or generic?
- Form/booking functionality working correctly?

**Reasoning**: With increasing competition, conversion rate becomes more
critical. Client's observation of fewer bookings may indicate landing page issues.


### 5. THIS WEEK: Protect the Brand Campaign
**Est. Impact**: Maintain best performer

**Action**:
- Keep Brand budget at $40/day (may even increase to $50)
- Review Brand keywords for any waste
- Ensure Brand is capturing all branded searches

**Reasoning**: Brand campaign is performing at $35 CPA (70% of target).
This is your best performer - don't let budget cuts affect it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Net Impact Projection

If we implement all 5 actions:

| Metric | Current | Projected | Change |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Monthly Spend | $11,160 (trend) | ~$2,800 | -75% |
| Monthly Conv | ~130 (trend) | ~45-55 | -58% |
| Avg CPA | $86 | ~$55-60 | -35% |
| vs Budget | 372% over | On target | Fixed |

**Note**: Conversion volume will drop as we cut waste, but we'll be getting
*real* conversions at a sustainable CPA within budget.
