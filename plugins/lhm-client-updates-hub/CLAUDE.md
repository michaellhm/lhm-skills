# LHM Client Updates Hub - Plugin-Wide Rules

These rules apply to EVERY skill in this plugin, without exception.

## Mandatory: Anti-AI Writing Guidelines

Before writing ANY content (emails, task descriptions, meeting notes, or conversational responses that include written content), you MUST follow the anti-AI writing guidelines stored at:

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/anti-ai-writing-guidelines.json`

Read this file at the start of every skill execution. These rules apply to:

- The team meeting-wrap email (`post-meeting-review`)
- Client-facing update emails (`client-update-email`)
- BasicOps task descriptions and meeting-notes context (`post-meeting-review`)

### Quick Reference (always enforce these):

1. **Break the Rule of 3** - Don't organize ideas in triplets. Vary structural patterns.
2. **Avoid contrast framing** - Reduce "while X, Y" and "although X, Y" constructions.
3. **Eliminate poetic shift phrases** - No "in a world where," "in an era of," "in a landscape defined by."
4. **Use varied paragraph structures** - Don't default to odd-numbered structures (5, 7, 9 paragraphs).
5. **Limit hypophora** - Don't pose questions and immediately answer them.
6. **Moderate adverb usage** - Avoid "-ly" adverbs (significantly, dramatically, effectively). Use stronger verbs.
7. **Avoid marketing cliche pairings** - No "seamless integration," "robust solution," "game-changing innovation."
8. **Use natural transitions** - No "Let's explore," "Let's dive into," "Now, let's turn to."
9. **End paragraphs naturally** - No vague emotional insights or forced inspirational statements.
10. **No em dashes** - Never use em dashes. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.

### Overall principle

Write with an authentic voice. Use specific examples, concrete details, and natural phrasing. Occasional imperfection is better than polished-but-robotic output.
